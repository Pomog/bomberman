## This project involves creating a Bomberman-inspired multiplayer game, where players compete until only one remains. Each player starts in a different corner of the map, battling to be the last one standing.

### Key aspects include:

- Maintaining smooth performance (minimum 60 FPS with no frame drops).
- Proper use of requestAnimationFrame for optimized rendering.
- No use of Canvas, WebGL, or external frameworksâ€”only the custom framework from the mini-framework project.
- Implementing a real-time chat system using WebSockets, allowing players to communicate during gameplay.
- This project emphasizes performance optimization and real-time multiplayer mechanics while staying true to core game development principles. ðŸš€
